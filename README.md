# Porject : Explore-Weather-Trends
### by Qasim Hassan

## Summary
In this project, I'll analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. Moreover i will use SQL query to extract data from the given Data base and i have to visualize the insight or Average temperature to find the findings.

## Instructions
Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, you’ll follow the steps below:

### 1-Extract the data from the database. 
 I’ll need to export the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where you live. I will havee a list of cities and countries in the city_list table. To interact with the database, I'll need to write a SQL query.
        - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
        - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
        
### Open up the CSV 
open the CSV in whatever tool you feel most comfortable using.I'll use <a href = "https://www.anaconda.com/">Anadconda Distribution</a> From which i will install <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.8.2</a> and <a href = "https://jupyter.org/install">Jupyter Notebook</a>to process my data.

### Create a line chart
then After Data Processing the Next Task is to Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. #### NOTE: 
Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).

### Make observations
Then we should have to make Necessary Observation's about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get you started.
1-Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? 
2-Has the difference been consistent over time?
3-How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
4-What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? 
5-Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
